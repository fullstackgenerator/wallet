#### Motivation:  
I built this app because:  
1. I enjoy Laravelâ€™s no-nonsense approach.  
2. I like keeping track of my finances.  

#### What's under the hood:  
- Laravel â€“ a solid framework for a solid app.  
- Laravel Excel â€“ makes exporting data effortless.  
- Tabler â€“ keeps the UI clean and simple.  
- Javascript â€“ just a touch for interactivity.  

#### How to use:  
1. Enter Income or Expenses: Input your data on the left, and once you select one option (e.g., income), the other gets disabled. Some example data is already given.
